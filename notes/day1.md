# Day 1: Introduction to Networking & OSI Model

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the OSI Model layers.
- Explore basic networking concepts.

## 📚 Theoretical Study

- Watched: [OSI Model Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0)
- Read: [Introduction to the OSI Model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)

## 🧪 Practical Lab

- Completed: TryHackMe's "Introductory Networking" room.
- Tool Used: Wireshark to analyze packet structures.

## 📝 Notes

- The OSI Model consists of 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
- Each layer serves a specific function in data transmission.

## 🧠 Reflection

- **Takeaways**:
  - Clear understanding of how data flows through the OSI layers.
  - Practical experience with packet analysis using Wireshark.
- **Challenges**:
  - Differentiating between the functions of each OSI layer.
