# 📅 Day 3: IP Addressing and Subnetting

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure of IPv4 addresses, including public vs. private IPs, subnet masks, and default gateways.
- Master subnetting concepts: dividing networks into subnets, calculating subnet ranges, and understanding CIDR notation.
- Apply these concepts in a virtual lab to configure and analyze network traffic.

## 🧪 Practical Lab

### ✅ IP Configuration on VMs
- **VM1:** 192.168.1.10/24
- **VM2:** 192.168.1.20/24
- **VM3:** 192.168.2.10/24

### ✅ Connectivity Tests
- Pinged between VMs on the same subnet – ✅ Success
- Pinged between VMs on different subnets – ❌ Failed (no routing)

### 🔢 Subnet Calculations
- Manual CIDR to IP range: /25 and /26
- Verified using [Subnet Calculator](https://www.subnet-calculator.com/)

### 🔍 Packet Analysis
- Captured ICMP traffic using Wireshark
- Applied filters for specific IP packets (e.g., `icmp`, `ip.addr==192.168.1.10`)

## 🧠 Key Concepts and Notes

### 📌 IPv4 Addressing
- **Format:** 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- **Private IP Ranges:**
  - `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`
  - `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`
  - `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`
- **Subnet Mask:** Separates network and host parts of IP (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
- **Default Gateway:** Router IP used for external network access

### 📌 Subnetting
- **CIDR Notation:** `/24` = `255.255.255.0`
- **Number of Subnets:** `2^n` (n = bits borrowed from host)
- **Hosts per Subnet:** `2^(32 - subnet bits) - 2`
- **Example: 192.168.1.0/26**
  - `192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63`
  - `192.168.1.64 – 192.168.1.127`
  - `192.168.1.128 – 192.168.1.191`
  - `192.168.1.192 – 192.168.1.255`



## 🔄 Reflection

- ✅ Gained solid knowledge of IP addressing, subnetting, and network layout logic
- ✅ Strengthened ability to interpret packet behavior using Wireshark
